#Intro
Daniel Morrissey and Lisa Hobbs
Prior to release version 2.2.2, Python differentiated integer types as most languages do, IE with an int, a short int and a long type. Starting in 2.2.2, as outlined by Python Enhancement Proposal number 237, these three types were reimplimented as one single type, int. This unified type appears to the user as an arbitrary precision integer, limited in size only by the hardware of the running system (this was the previous functionality of the long type pre 2.4). This change diminishes the overhead and errors that can occur by integer overflow and mixed type aritmetic. The change also extends the convenience of python, which already hid the memory relations for types such as strings.
    
    1) Implementation
        A) Phases
        B) 2 Possible implementations
            A) an actual union
            B) short and long types still exist, common superclass integer
        C) Obstacles
            A) Underlying C code still has to be aware of short vs long
            B) 
    1) Error fixes
        A) Short, long and int problems
        B) Vs 32bit and 64bit numbers
        C) Portability
    2) Convenience
        A) User no longer needs to worry about compatibilities, simple
        B) 



#Points: 
        - Simplification on user end
        - No need for multiple types for extending integer precision
        - Dependant only on hardware
        
        
#Pros
        - One type for integers
        
        
#Cons/Obstacles
        - Underlying c code must still use multiple precisions
        
        
        
#Versions: 
        - Implementation begun in 2.2

# Implementation
### Pep Created 11-Mar-2001
### Email chain is from 2006

An email chain from 2006 between Python author Guido van Rossum, and various underlings, details the implementation process and their thinking behind it. 

	"Completely gut intobject.[ch], making all PyInt APIs equivalent to
	 the corresponding PyLong APIs (through macros if possible). The PyInt
	 macros become functions. I'm not sure whether it would be better for
	 PyInt_Check() to always return False or to always return True. In
	 bltinmodule, export "int" as an alias for "long""

					-Guido van Rossum explaining to Martin v. LÃ¶wis how he would implement a single integer type


Guido chose to replace all of the current PyInt code with the existing PyLong code, and present these changes to the user as one type. As Rossum remarked "[this simplification] is best for Python-level users." The reason the underlying code must still differentiate is because Python is built upon C, which must be aware of integer precision. 


#User Benefit
The implementation of PEP 237 meant Python users no longer have to worry about when to use int or long or worry about library support for the different types. 









###personal example
I wrote a large number factoring program in scala this semester for another class. We were learning RSA, so the numbers we had to factor were much larger than scala's internal int class could handle. I had to write the program using the BigInt library (still capped at a specified size, not by hardware). Most of the scala internal libraries I used supported BigInt just fine (besides square root, but theres no square root for Int either).
